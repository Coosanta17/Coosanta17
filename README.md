## Hi! I’m @Coosanta17!

I make Minecraft Java edition Datapacks (amateur) and do (failed) attempts on mods

To contact me for anything except spam my discord is `Coosanta#7004`

### **Projects I'm currently working on**
**[The Amalgam](https://github.com/Coosanta17/Amalgam)** -  *Under development (used to be [The Trimensions](https://github.com/Coosanta17/Trimensions) but got merged)* 

**Moonlord** - *An rpg I'm (sort of) working on (I don't have the time or money to really get into it)*

*I have other small projects that I usually lose interest in quickly but you can check it out on my profile*

I'm not very active on github so best to use discord.

**discord server (mainly for the Amalgam):**
