## Hi! I’m @Coosanta17!

I make Minecraft Java edition Datapacks (amateur) and do (failed) attempts on mods

Languages I am fluent in are: English, Java, Grand Stave and Bass clef.

Languages I am learning are: JavaScript, Python, and Chinese.

To contact me for anything except spam my discord is `coosanta`

### Projects I'm currently working on
**[The Amalgam](https://github.com/Coosanta17/Amalgam)** - *(on hiatus)*

*I have other small projects that I usually lose interest in quickly but you can check it out on my profile*

My projects progress very slowly because I am busy and programming is a low priority
